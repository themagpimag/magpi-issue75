// of tiles and the InitTiles(this) to load and set up
// We could also move this code up to the constructor, but generally speaking if the constructor is doing a lot of things we usually have an init funciton instead
// just to keep things a bit cleaner. This is doing 3 things.. Loading&creating texure, calculating the UV coords of the tiles, and finally creating a VBO

// Start by scanning through the map, finding out which tile is to be drawn.
// Then work out the position of its 6 vectors and is UV coordinates
// store them all into a nice big array or vector (vector are better for this as they are more dynamic)
// Once we have a buffer transfer it to the GPU memory	
// then when its time to write, use the GPU memory buffer
// All this setting up, takes a little bit of time, but its only ever done once...at a point where we're not watchng the screen
// which means the user will never see this slow setup, but will appreciate the faster update.
